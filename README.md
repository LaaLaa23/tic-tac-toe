As an assignment for our 3rd week of Web Development Immersive with General Assembly, we were tasked to create a "Tic-Tac-Toe" game (what we in the UK call 'Noughts and Crosses').

 Applying the skills I have learned in the first 2 weeks of our course (and I still feel that I'm at close to zero - but it's significantly more than I thought I would have), and using simple Html and CSS for the design and layout, and Javascript with jQuery to run the program and manipulate the DOM.

The result is a functioning game, although simple and basic looking, working as expected (at least at the time of writing this ReadMe).

Starting from scratch, I'm pleased to have got it working, although the JS code could do with much re-factoring because I didn't want to push it too hard and break everything.

And having so many ways to solve this 'problem' and create this game I found very distracting and in particular the design in the CSS and the layout, which I again ended up going for a very basic look to avoid issues... Otherwise, I hope you enjoy!
